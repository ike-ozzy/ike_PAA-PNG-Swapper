# ike_PAA-PNG-Swapper
This is a tour that allows you to convert your PAA image files to PNG 's and vice versa. Once installed you will be able to place all the images you need converted into one folder and execute a.bat That will do the rest for you.

 Installation instructions 
-----------------------------

1. Copy the following text------> ike's Tools

2.Open P:Drive 

3.Create New Folder > paste "ike's Tools" as the title

*note- if you already have this folder from another tool of ike_0zzy's you should already have the folder > skip step  [ 3.]

4. Open ike's Tools folder 

5. Drag or paste [ike_PAA+PNG Swapper] into ike's Tools folder 

6. Open [ike_PAA+PNG Swapper] folder > check both the [paa] & [png] folder's .bat with notepad++ by selecting it > right click > edit with notepad++

Now double check line:4 path > correct path is below--->

"P:\ike's Tools\ike_PAA+PNG Swapper\ikeSwaP.exe"

7. Run either .bat and the test image should convert

If all is correct then then PeepoHappy Happy Time!---> {installation Complete}

----------------
How it works
----------------

Place your images in the corresponding folders and then you can double click the .bat executable and it will begin the process. It should create a temp folder and do its thing afterwards you will have both versions in your folder and can move them wherever you need. *the consol will prompt to PRESS ANY KEY be sure to do this to close it out before doing another conversion. 

I recommend only having the images that you need in there as it will try to do everything in the folder each time. 

Hope you enjoy, this is a very useful tool considering the different errors that you'll get with the standard Image To PAA sometimes No other application is available for converting back to a PNG.
